1. Start from examples specifically from Atmel Start
2. Add modules as per requiremnet
3. If using USART module look for device receiving and transmiting pins. (Select the right one, see USART component in datasheet for help)
For Cortex M0+
RX - PA23
TX - PA22

4. Links on Microchip website are not updated (See documnets year)
ASF4 API OR ASF Manual (SAM L21)

5. For measuremnets include gpio_init.c/h files
Change DGI GPIO port pins according to PINMUX (Get help from datasheet or atmel start)
include the header of gpio_init.c in atmel_start.h file and
define "#define INIT_GPIO" in atmel_start_pins.h file
