# Benchmarking-for-Securing-Persistent-State-in-Intermittent-Computing


This repository includes the code for benchmarking different security mechanisms to protect
persistent state in intermittent computing. The code for benchmarks run directly on bare-metal without operating
system support. They emulate the occurrence of checkpoint and
restore operations, while measuring the overhead of given security
mechanisms.


## For getting started:

Install PyDGILib, 
PyDGILib provides python bindings for AtmelÂ® Data Gateway Interface (DGI) devices.
The live version of the documentation can be found at https://ewouters.github.io/ pydgilib.
The documentation is very extensive and while the getting started example
shows an easy way to get going, it should enable people to use the full extend of the library
